## TPT Notes ðŸ˜Ž
### Week 0 (5.1-5.2)
TPT 0.1: Benefit of drones, photography and military use but you can provide surveillance to people. Downside would be an invasion of privacy.
- Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing: Beneficial things are greater accessibility, simulating unlikely situations, and uniting people from far distances. Harmful effects of computing are lost lives in more imoprtant technologies like transportation technologies, bad algorithms to solve important problems and bringing bias into important decisions
- Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?: I thikn dopamine issues are definitely real. Technology provides too much access to easy highs of dopamine which reduces brain sensitivity to it. I see it impacting my high school career in work ethic and making it harder for me to get tasks done.

TPT 0.2: Digital Empowerment
- How does someone empower themself in a digital world?: Use their technology to advocate for other people's success.
- How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.: I could empower someone to resources that they can access and let them borrow my materials.
- Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?: Probably not blocking that much. I think it makes sense that some things are blocked or distracting, but some things are limiting. I'm not exactly sure what technology empowers- but maybe topic that facilitates greater connection.

### Week 1 (5.3-5.4)
TPT 1.0: Computer Bias Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas... Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
- I feel like the owner of the computer doesn't think its intentional. I would hope they didn't try to discriminate against one group of people based on skin color. How do you think this happened?
Likely the people in the workspace were not diverse. Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Should it be corrected?
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

TPT 1.1: Crowdsourcing CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- A crowdsource idea could be to randomly sample a few people from CS classes, and also make that a bigger part of our process. We could take feedback on a google form. 
- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
- Del Norte crowdsourcing would be best for a random sample. The final project would be much better with crowdsourcing as a variety of different things are taken into account.
