# AP EXAM PREP (MC & CREATE TASK)
### Multiple Choice
- [x] **TUES:** Finals-Quiz1 42/50 and corrections
- **WEDS:** Take test then brush up on the ones that you missed, do corrections for these. Then choose a topic to do a deep focus/review on based on what you missed most on Tues (Weds)
- [ ] **THURS:** Finals-Quiz2 score/50 and reflections
- **FRI:** Take test then brush up on the ones that you missed, do corrections for these. Then choose a second topic to do a deep focus/review on based on what you missed the most on Weds (Fri)

### Create Task (Every day after school)
- [ ] Create Task code/runtime and 1 min video are reviewed by another person, you may request Teacher review as time permits
- A counter for number of times it has inputted
- For each value of the magnitude someone adds, it adds the magnitude to the list (and possibly recomputes the average every time & it will tell you if the magnitude you did (maybe call it ‚Äúevaluate/eval‚Äù) is greater than the one you felt)
- Ask Mr. Mortensen: Do I have to remake the graph function? Maybe I‚Äôll just change a few variables‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want to be counted as plagiarism (changing some variables, making new comments, changing square function to a diamond or a circle)

# TPT Notes üòé
### Week 0 (5.1-5.2)
**TPT 0.1: Benefit of drones, photography and military use but you can provide surveillance to people. Downside would be an invasion of privacy.**
- Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing: Beneficial things are greater accessibility, simulating unlikely situations, and uniting people from far distances. Harmful effects of computing are lost lives in more imoprtant technologies like transportation technologies, bad algorithms to solve important problems and bringing bias into important decisions
- Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?: I thikn dopamine issues are definitely real. Technology provides too much access to easy highs of dopamine which reduces brain sensitivity to it. I see it impacting my high school career in work ethic and making it harder for me to get tasks done.
- Come up with times in which drones have affected the daily lives of people living in foreign countries. Explain how these events destroyed people's homes and what the lasting effects had on many young people affected by the drone attacks.

**TPT 0.2: Digital Empowerment**
- How does someone empower themself in a digital world?: Use their technology to advocate for other people's success.
- How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.: I could empower someone to resources that they can access and let them borrow my materials.
- Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?: Probably not blocking that much. I think it makes sense that some things are blocked or distracting, but some things are limiting. I'm not exactly sure what technology empowers- but maybe topic that facilitates greater connection.

### Week 1 (5.3-5.4)
**TPT 1.0: Computer Bias**
Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
- I feel like the owner of the computer doesn't think its intentional. I would hope they didn't try to discriminate against one group of people based on skin color.
How do you think this happened?
- Likely the people in the workspace were not diverse.
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
Should it be corrected?
- Yes, it should be.
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
- I can make a better effort to hire people with more diverse perspectives.

**TPT 1.1: Crowdsourcing**
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- A crowdsource idea could be to randomly sample a few people from CS classes, and also make that a bigger part of our process. We could take feedback on a google form.
What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
- Del Norte crowdsourcing would be best for a random sample. The final project would be much better with crowdsourcing as a variety of different things are taken into account.

### Week 2 (5.5-5.6)
**TPT 5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns**
- Every software has some sort of license. 
- Patent: essentially protecting an idea you make. Patent lawyers protect to make sure the patent is maintained and the patent is protected. 
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
- There are Apache License 2.0, GNU General Public License v3.0 - free for everybody else, completely free. MIT license - use code freely and distribute closed source versions. Closed source means its protected. GPL, open source, creative commons are all esentially "free" but could impact your ability to collect revenue.
2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

**TPT 5.6: Safe Computing**
- Every software has some sort of license.
- Factors to increase security of system- most systems use two factor authentication and cryptography and encryption
1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
- Our names and where we were born
2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
- It scares me how much information is easily accessible.
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
- Bad passwords are comon words and letterforms, good passwords include multiple characters.
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
- Symmetric encryption is where only a secret key is used. Asymmetric is only when it uses a pair of related keys- one public and private key
5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
- Raspberry Pi has in IP address
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
- My dad has an email and he once clicked on a phishing email. I got mad at him. Also it could be clicking on links that look authentic.
